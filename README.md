Zen Garden is a single page site that was built as a demonstration of the flexibility and versatility of CSS.  

This site was built as a replica of the original CSS ZenGarden site based on a Photoshop Document - not by cloning their code.  It is fully responsive, dynamic, and the layout changes on every device size.  The links do not work since it was designed as a PSD mockup for a SPA.

See what the beauty of CSS can do for you!
